"""oasdiff_adapter.py — convergence-point adapter: oasdiff breaking-change → 越权日志.

A SIBLING convergence-point gate (like arch_contract_api.py / spectral_adapter.py /
semgrep_adapter.py), NOT a hand-rolled heuristic. It shells out to the ARMED oasdiff CLI
(armed globally via `brew install oasdiff`) and translates its JSON breaking-change
report into the loop's 越权日志 schema (`{gate, passed, coverage, findings[]}`). See
references/external-skills.md.

COMPLEMENTARY to `spectral_adapter.py`, NOT a replacement — they check DIFFERENT axes:
  - `spectral_adapter.py` lints ONE spec's STYLE/RULESET (operation-ids, naming, security,
    parameter rules) against spectral:oas + .spectral.yaml. Static, single-spec.
  - `oasdiff_adapter.py` DIFFS two versions of a spec (working vs git HEAD) and reports
    BREAKING changes against existing clients (removed/required fields, narrowed types,
    changed enum, removed paths/operations, ...). Diffs a pair; needs a base.
Do not delete one for the other.

Base spec = git HEAD version of the tracked spec, materialized via `git show HEAD:<relpath>`
to a temp file. oasdiff is invoked per spec: `oasdiff breaking --format json <base> <working>`.
Exit code: 0 = no breaking changes, non-zero = breaking changes present (the JSON report is
emitted on stdout regardless with --format json; the adapter parses stdout independent of
exit). Each entry in the report carries a change id/type + description; the adapter maps
`id/type -> rule`, `description -> detail`, and synthesizes a `suggestion`.

This gate is ADVISORY: it never emits `blocker` (rule 4 — a breaking change may be intentional,
e.g. a major-version bump on a new minor release), so `passed` is always True; findings surface
for the run-record + outer ring. Never silently green: it always reports `coverage` (what ran
+ what was skipped).

GAPS (rule 3):
  - Only DIFFS specs TRACKED in git (the base is `HEAD:<relpath>`). A brand-new spec not yet in
    HEAD has no base to diff → SKIPPED with an explicit coverage note ("no base to diff (spec
    not in git HEAD) — skipped"). It is NOT silently green.
  - Breaking changes are ADVISORY, never `blocker` by default — a breaking change may be
    intentional (major-version bump, deprecation). Review at the outer ring if unsure.
  - Complements `spectral_adapter.py` (style) + `arch-contract-api` (presence/path) — does
    NOT replace either, and does NOT check that the implementation CODE matches the spec
    (that stays arch-contract-api path-check + outer-ring / contract tests).
  - When `git` is absent on PATH, ALL specs are skipped (no base can be materialized) and the
    gate no-ops with a coverage note.

Usage: oasdiff_adapter.py   (no args; walks $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR or CWD)
       Operates on $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (or CWD). No-op (coverage note) when oasdiff is not
       armed, when no OpenAPI/Swagger artifact exists, or when no spec is tracked in git HEAD.
