"""license_adapter.py — convergence-point adapter: Trivy license scan → 越权日志.

A SIBLING convergence-point gate (like arch_contract_deps.py / semgrep_adapter.py /
spectral_adapter.py), NOT a hand-rolled heuristic. It shells out to the ARMED Trivy CLI
(armed globally via `brew install trivy`) and translates its license findings into the
loop's 越权日志 schema (`{gate, passed, coverage, findings[]}`). See references/external-skills.md.

COMPLEMENTARY to `arch_contract_deps.py`, NOT a replacement:
  - `arch_contract_deps.py` covers leaked SECRETS (gitleaks) + dependency CVEs.
  - `license_adapter.py` covers dependency LICENSES (copyleft / permissive / unknown) via
    Trivy's license scanner. Different axis — a clean CVE record says nothing about whether
    the dependency's license is acceptable for this project.

Trivy's license scanner (`trivy fs --scanners license --format json`) emits `{Results[]}`, each
result having a `Licenses[]` of `{PkgName, Version, License[Name], Severity, Layer, Path}`. The
adapter walks `Results[]`, collects every license entry, and maps `License.Name -> rule`,
`PkgName -> file` (package-level, `line=0`), `License <name> on <pkg> -> detail`, and COLLAPSES
severity to `warning` (see GAP). If the shape differs from expected, the adapter coverage-notes
and skips (degrade safely — never silently green).

This is a DEPTH-1 advisory rule gate (no per-feature frozen anchor — license policy is repo-wide
config, unlike Spectral's frozen spec).

ADVISORY: never emits `blocker` (rule 4 — license policy is opinion, not a code defect), so
`passed` is always True; findings surface for the run-record + outer ring. Never silently green:
always reports `coverage` (what ran + what was skipped), and degrades to a documented no-op
when Trivy is not armed OR there are no dependency/lockfile markers.

GAPS (rule 3):
  - Trivy is security-scanner-shaped; license scanning is one MODE (`--scanners license`). It
    scans the dependency tree of detected lockfiles / manifests, not source text.
  - License findings need a project POLICY (allow/deny list — e.g. reject GPL-3.0, allow MIT)
    to be actionable. Without one, this gate emits a raw license INVENTORY — noisy and not
    itself a verdict. The policy lives in `.trivyignore` / `trivy-secret.yaml` / project config
    (outer-ring concern); this adapter does not enforce it.
  - Per-license severity is advisory: Trivy maps a default license-category severity (copyleft
    -> HIGH, etc.), but whether a license is acceptable is opinion, not a code defect. Severity
    COLLAPSES to `warning` (越权日志 enum is `blocker|warning`; advisory never `blocker`). The
    raw Trivy level is kept in `detail` text.
  - Copyleft / compatibility analysis (GPL viral spread, license compatibility between deps)
    is legal judgment and stays OUTER-RING (LLM review / human legal) — not deterministic.

Usage: license_adapter.py [target...]   (default: cwd)
       Operates on $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (or CWD). No-op (coverage note) when Trivy is not armed
       or no dependency/lockfile markers are present.
