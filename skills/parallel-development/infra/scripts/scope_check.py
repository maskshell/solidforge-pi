"""scope_check.py — the task-boundary BELONGING gate (ADR #15).

Post-hoc check at the Coder→orchestrator handoff: a Coder subagent's ACTUAL writes must be ⊆ its declared `files_touched` ∪ an allowlist. Correctness gates (fast/arch) verify "is the code right"; this verifies "do these changes BELONG to this task". A correctness-clean but out-of-scope write — e.g. an interrupted subagent that rewrote the skill's own infra + added deps + touched the lockfile — passes every other gate; this is the only one that catches it. See ADR #15.

Verdict semantics (flag-not-block, post-hoc): scope_check cannot refuse writes that already happened; it FLAGS them for the orchestrator to handle — discard the out-of-scope paths (`git checkout HEAD -- <paths>`), keep a coherent in-scope diff, or `snapshot.py restore <task>`. Never silently merge out-of- scope changes. Exit non-zero on `flag` so the orchestrator must handle it before aggregating / building on the result. Sacred-path hard-DENY is a SEPARATE PreToolUse hook (a blueprint_guard.py generalization, ADR #15c), not this script: scope_check reports sacred-path touches at the highest severity, but being post-hoc it still flags rather than prevents.

Usage:
  scope_check.py --task-base <ref> --files-touched <path,path,...> [--allow <glob,glob,...>] [--sacred <glob,glob,...>]

  --task-base <ref>        git ref/commit the Coder was dispatched from (a snapshot ref `refs/pd-snap/...` or HEAD at dispatch). Required.
  --files-touched <csv>    the task's declared files_touched (the orchestrator knows these from TaskCreate metadata). May be empty.
  --allow <csv>            extra allowlist globs (fnmatch; `*` spans `/`, use `**` as a segment wildcard) for genuinely incidental artifacts to tolerate.
  --sacred <csv>           extra sacred-path globs (never a legitimate target).

The default allowlist is intentionally EMPTY (strict): a well-declared task lists its own regenerables (goldens, `__init__.py` exports, a declared lockfile) in `files_touched`, so they are in-scope. Use `--allow` only for incidental artifacts you consciously choose to tolerate (false-positive suppression); prefer false flags over false negatives.

Default sacred paths: `.claude/parallel-dev/**` — the installed skill's own infra, which an implementation subagent must never rewrite.

Glossary of the JSON output groups:
  in_scope       changed AND declared (or matching nothing — fine).
  allowlisted    changed, not declared, but matched an allow glob (tolerated; NOT a violation).
  violations     changed, not declared, not allowlisted, not sacred -> FLAG.
  sacred         changed and matched a sacred glob -> FLAG, highest severity.
