"""drift_check.py — drift-detection self-gate (ADVISORY; workspace rule 4).

A self-contained (rule 7) structural checker, data-driven by a sibling registry
`drift_registry.json`. It surfaces DIVERGENCE in the duplicated boilerplate that the
self-contained-script convention mandates (rule 7): a named sibling set — e.g. the
`emit(findings, coverage)` helper across the adapter family — whose members SHOULD
match after a normalized-text diff (ODP-2: strip comments + whitespace) but have
copy-paste-diverged.

Severity is ADVISORY (rule 4: a heuristic-surface check never Blocks). Drift findings
are `warning`, the gate always exits 0, and `passed` is always True. The registry is the
heuristic surface (which sites should match is a human curation, not a proven fact); the
diff is the deterministic comparator over it. A registry omission degrades to a coverage
note, never a silent green (rule 3).

Self-contained (rule 7): duplicates the `read` / `emit` helpers used across the skill's
other infra scripts rather than importing a shared lib, so it stays independently
deployable. Pure stdlib. `drift_check.py` itself is a one-member family for now; ODP-3
(self-dogfood drift against future siblings) activates once a second sibling exists.

Usage:
    python3 infra/test/drift_check.py            # read drift_registry.json, emit + exit 0
