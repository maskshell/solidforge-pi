"""converge.py — deterministic convergence-policy engine for cross-source-review (CSR-I4).

PURE POLICY ENGINE — NO LLM CALLS. The orchestrator runs the legs (the same-family doc-reviewer
agent + the different-family hetero_doc_review.py substrate) and feeds each round's findings to this
engine, which reconciles + judges substantive-convergence + emits the convergence-record.

Authority chain: docs/proposal.md §3 (convergence POLICY + per-round reconciliation table +
pluggable seams), §9 Q3 (convergence-record schema); docs/iteration-plan.md §CSR-I4 (Goal /
Deliverables / Done-when — BOTH prongs + pluggable seam); infra/schemas/
convergence-record.schema.json (the output contract — must emit a schema-valid record);
infra/schemas/doc-findings.schema.json (each leg's finding shape).

Self-contained (workspace rule 7): pure stdlib + jsonschema (when available) for
validation. No imports from pd's loop_state or any shared lib (proposal Q3 — the doc
domain does NOT drive pd's loop_state state machine; field NAMES are aligned for
Phase-B map-ability only).

Graceful-skip (workspace rules 1 + 3 — tests skip when external tools absent; never
fake a green gate): when jsonschema is NOT importable, the pluggable-seam
findings-schema validation + the convergence-record schema validation are SKIPPED
with an honest coverage note in the emitted record; the CORE reconciliation +
substantive-convergence judgment (which do NOT need jsonschema) still run. This
mirrors the HAVE_JSONSCHEMA pattern in converge_fixtures/verify.py and the
token-skip in dogfood.py. Install jsonschema (or run under
`uv run --with jsonschema ...`) for full pluggable-seam + record validation.

==============================================================================
POLICY (proposal §3, implemented EXACTLY):
  Per-round reconciliation (the §3 table):
    - combined findings = same_findings + (hetero_findings if NOT hetero_degraded else [])
      — when different-family DEGRADED, the leg contributed nothing; the same-family primary stands
      (degraded flag persisted for the coverage trail).
    - a finding is a BLOCKER iff severity == "blocker".
    - new_blockers = blockers whose defect_id did NOT appear in any PRIOR round's blocker
      set (de-dup by defect_id across the whole run).
    - round.blockers = count of new_blockers this round.
    - round.verdict = "rewrite" if new_blockers else "pass".
      (The schema's third verdict — "adversarial-stalemate" — is reserved for the
      orchestrator layer, which makes the persistent-disagreement semantic call across
      rounds; a pure policy engine cannot derive it from one round's findings alone.)
  Run-level substantive-convergence (BOTH prongs):
    - prong_b (no-new-Blocker): the last >=2 rounds each had 0 new_blockers
      (and at least 2 rounds exist).
    - prong_a (core-claims-coverage): every entry in core_claims appears in the union of
      core_claims_covered across all rounds. Empty core_claims → prong_a vacuously true
      (the doc declared no explicit core-claim set — declared honestly in coverage).
    - substantive_converged = prong_a AND prong_b.
    - stalemate = (NOT substantive_converged) AND (len(rounds) >= cap)
      — cap-hit escalates to the human, never silent-pick (pd ADR #40 (e)).
    - rightness = "human_confirm_required" (constant — outcome-axis isolation; a green
      process axis NEVER changes this constant — the skill does not judge whether the
      doc is right).
    - coverage = honest notes (rule 3 — never silent):
        * per degraded round: "round N different-family degraded[: <subtype>]"
        * "core-claims-coverage: <covered>/<total>" when core_claims non-empty
        * "cap=<cap>, rounds=<n>" always

PLUGGABLE SEAM (proposal §3 — cheap thing Phase A MUST get right):
  --findings-schema validates EACH input finding against the given schema's $defs/finding
  subshape (default doc-findings.schema.json). A future code-shaped caller passes a schema
  whose $defs/finding is the violation-log shape. A finding that fails validation is
  REJECTED with a clear error (rule 3 — never silently accept malformed input; the CSR-I5
  findings shape-contract gate builds on this).
==============================================================================

Exit codes: 0 = clean record emitted (pass OR rewrite-due-to-blocker — the engine
succeeded); 1 = policy/contract violation (malformed finding, invalid run shape,
record failed schema validation); 2 = argument/IO error.
