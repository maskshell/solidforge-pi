"""verdict.py — the two-field verdict-emitter (iteration I6).

Aggregates the inner ring (constraints_check I3 / research_constraints I4) and the outer ring (plan_reviewer I5 findings) into a spec run-record with exactly two verdict fields, kept structurally isolated (ADR #11; arch-design §5 is the requirement source):

  - process_converged (process axis): high confidence, convergeable. true iff the inner ring passed AND the outer ring has no Blocker.
  - rightness (outcome axis): the CONSTANT 'human_confirm_required'. The outcome axis (is the artifact 'right') is out of this skill's scope — always human.

FIELD ISOLATION (the I6 DoD): rightness is set to the constant UNCONDITIONALLY — it never reads process_converged. The run-record schema reinforces this: rightness is an enum with exactly ONE value. A green process axis therefore can never change rightness. A consumer must not misread process_converged as outcome-axis success.

The outer-ring findings are supplied by the caller (the convergence loop spawns the plan_reviewer and passes its findings). When the outer ring did not run, the caller passes outer={} and the record carries a coverage note (process_converged stays False — no convergence without the outer ring). CLI:
